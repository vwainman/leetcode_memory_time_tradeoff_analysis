# [58] Length of Last Word
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/
#
# Given a string s consistingÂ of some words separated by some number of spaces,
# return the length of the last word in the string.
#
# A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

    # Time = O(n + m) where n = length of last word and m = length of trailing spaces
    # Memory = O(1)

    # the length of the last word

    # remove trailing spaces

    length: int = 0

    # travel by reverse indexing
